                  So what's the deal with this world?
                </p>
                <p>
                  The earth was built out of the body of a dormant goddess called <i>Tellus.</i> From her flesh and the
                  influence of outer divinities sprout life and magic. Also called
                  <i>"The Fractured Realm"</i>
                  this is a place brimming with the presence of the supernatural and gods in the modern day. This world
                  is corrupted and full of cracks, from which lesser gods spawn, messing around with the lives of the
                  mortals on it while they try to live in ignorence, going around the earth trying to keep a semblance
                  of normality.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Within it, five great continents meet: Ereblia, Hemeria, A'ither/Zefiro, An'elya, and Sucial. We can
                  look for similarities in these to the world we call home, but what cannot be denied is that it is an
                  existence plagued by the occult and the supernatural. People survive life knowing a secret that is
                  shared by word of mouth; <i>we are not the only beings who inhabit this place.</i> Supernatural
                  phenomena and unreal spaces abound everywhere, extremes of the world where existence and reality are
                  completely corrupted. All of this stalks people who only seek to live their days peacefully.

                      Although governed by 365-day years and 24-hour days, the planet of Tellus is larger than it
                      appears, the cracks in its reality allow for several hidden places on its surface, so there are
                      several areas of the world that have not yet been fully covered by human cities. The forests and
                      the oceans are still something to be feared and haven't been subdued by humanity's expansion, so
                      the humans entrust themselves to their gods for protection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The human population is smaller than what we have, therefore there is not a lot of population
                      density; this is thanks to this earth being a larger world, and thanks to the presence of greater
                      entities and divine forces, the conflict in people's lives is more present, and death by greater
                      forces is more common. In spite of that, people choose to live in ignorance and lead their daily
                      lives in a manner that's not really that different from ours...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A purely superstitious world because the presence of gods and other entities is somewhat obvious,
                      but the practice of more magical and spiritualistic things is done under the table because in
                      modern society it is frowned upon in part, especially with certain gods, so these types of events
                      are still a taboo.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      On Tellus, humans are the majority; but vampires and werewolves, or wizards/sorcerers, are also
                      abundant to some extent. A human can even have ancestry from a race with more peculiar qualities
                      (for example, a human with faerie lineage because at some point one of their ancestors had a child
                      with a nymph). Then, the lineages of elves, dwarves, orcs, goblins, and others species that are
                      typically called "Etheric Races" that physically prove not to be human, are rarer on Tellus due to
                      the massive genocide that was done to them long ago, perpetuated by humans. Therefore, the
                      communities that remain on the planet are extremely hidden and isolated, although you can still
                      see normal people who have slight ancestry from them.

                      Although the evolutionary theory exists because the bodies of humans and animals have changed over
                      the millennia, the creationist myth that humans and other living things come from the body of the
                      earth is naturally accepted even by the scientific society.

                    <li>
                      La ciencia naturalmente en parte tiene un enfoque algo místico, en específico con el estudio de
                      las energías divinas o los cuerpos de seres con vibras mas cargadas. Sin embargo, estas ramas de
                      la ciencia son complicadas y difíciles de estudiar, así que muy pocos pueden hacerlo. Hay mucha
                      presencia de lo que es la física cuántica como algo para explicar lo sobrenatural.

                    <li>
                      Astronomy is more primitive, however one thing that is known is that Tellus is apparently alone in
                      the galaxy, only being accompanied by the sun and his Moon. The “moon race” was never fully
                      realized as the war did not focus on this. People are partly afraid to explore space as such
                      because of the presence of the Cracked Moon, but there have been attempts to approach it to
                      collect moonstones, but humanity hasn't been able to set a foot on the Moon at all(it seems...)

                      There is no nuclear energy per-se, but there is something called Dealurgy; a branch of science
                      similar to metallurgy that instead of studying and treating metals, rather studies and molds the
                      traces of divine energy such as the ichor (the blood of the gods) and the fragments left behind by
                      them; in the most recent war there were many weapons and experiments made based on this same
                      science.

                      Neanderthals and such didn't really exists, humans, as a I said, were born spontaneously; but they
                      lived alongside other humanoid species such as elves and the like in the past, which were races
                      that were much older than "humanity" as it is now.

                  "The Ether"

                <p>
                  The "Ether" is the name that is given to a phenomena that occurs in the world of Tellus. Is a 
                  substance/energy that is said to be the "enemy to all matter and mind". Some people call it magic, 
                  arcane or pure chaos, this phenomena has been getting corrupted and it's corrosion perpetuates the world.
                  Some say that the gods, goddesses and deities are made of Ether.

                <p>
                  A long time ago; other species reigned the world and lived alongside humans, the "etheric people" were what 
                  we can consider elfs, beastkin, dwarfs, orcs, elementalkin, and the like, humanoids which had an inherent
                  understanding of <b>The Ether</b>, the essence of magic and the arcane in this world, unlike humans.
                  At some point in history they seemingly disappeared, leaving the humans to take control of Tellus, while 
                  other beings like vampires and werepeople took control. Despite this, some of those old species still live alongside humans,
                  hiding in plain sight or forming little communities in the hidden fractures of the world.
